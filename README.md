Controller Board for a Pinball Machine

This repository contains the schematics and PCB layout of a pinball machine controller. The purpose of such a controller is to perform tasks such as reading the status of a switch matrix, driving an LED (or lightbulb) matrix and drive a set of solenoids. 

More advanced features like playing music and sound-effects and loading game-logic and resources from an SD card are also planned and may be added in the future.

The board is designed as a Shield for the popular Arduino platform.
